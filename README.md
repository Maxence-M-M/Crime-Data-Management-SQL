# Crime-Data-Management-SQL

This is a SQL project created during my master in Business Analytics at Hult Internatioanl Business School.
The objective was to create a functionable database (Normalized ER-database) , queries and procedure. 
This database will help police make some link between cases/people/crimes but also keep up-to-date some information about criminals such as penalty/prison/judgement 
In addition , this model can help mangaging the prison capacity,the judgement process (Instances/Judge/Gulty or not Gulty/...) but also Evidences.

** Disclaimer ** : all the dates/numbers/names and others informations int he databases are random and does not reflect the reality.
